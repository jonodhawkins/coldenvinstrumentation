The application window will be open from 02 â€“ 29 October 2023. **Please submit your application before 11:59pm (GMT) on 29 October 2023**.

The Organising Committee will review each application and will rank each application according to the following criteria:

- the benefit that this training will have to your programme of research
- the benefit that this training will have to your personal and career development

We will notify everyone regarding the outcome of their application via email by **10 November 2023** at the latest. If you are successful in obtaining a place on the course, we ask that you confirm that you will be able to attend the course within 2 weeks of receiving your offer. If/as vacancies become available, we will then reach out to those on the waitlist to offer them the opportunity for a place on the course.

Barring any delays, the roster will be finalised by **01 December 2023** at the latest. After this date, we can only offer those on the waitlist a place on the course if a participant that has originally secured a place is unable to attend due to extenuating circumstances. We expect the likelihood of this to happen to be very low.
