The field course is open to around 20 participants, targeting primarily (but not exclusively) PhD students. Undergraduate and Master’s students, as well as postdoctoral researchers are welcome to apply. We will also take into account any career breaks, such as parental leave, sick leave, and national service.

Due to our funding sources, the course will need to give priority in the following order (1 for highest priority):

1. Current NERC-funded PhD students. However, if you have recently completed a NERC-funded PhD and missed out on field training experience due to the pandemic, you can apply and would be considered alongside current NERC-funded students.
2. Other UKRI-funded environmental scientists, including PhD students funded by other UKRI research councils, UKRI-funded or UKRI-sponsored research fellows (e.g. NERC Independent Research fellows; NERC Daphne Jackson Trust fellows) or early-career faculty in receipt of UKRI funding. In all cases you must demonstrate that your research programme aligns to NERC’s scientific remit, even if it is not funded by NERC.
3. All other students as well as early career researchers (ECRs), regardless of funding source or location of institution.

For clarity, our definition of “Early Career” is:

- any student or PhD candidate
- any academic on a fixed-term position, such as any postdoctoral research associate, teaching fellow, tutor or research fellow
- any junior member of faculty (e.g. lecturer, assistant professor) who has been in their present position for less than five years at 1.0FTE. Part-time staff may extend the 5 years pro-rata. Parental, medical or any other similar type of special leave does not count towards the five years.

If you are unclear about whether you are eligible, please write to us on <email> and explain your circumstances, and we’ll try and help.
