We strive to prioritise not only those that will benefit most academically and professionally, but also those that have been unable to access related opportunities, past or present. We acknowledge that this may arise from a number of factors, including as a result of an applicantâ€™s background or identity. We will also consider whether you will have opportunities to attend related field courses (e.g. Karthaus, McCarthy) in the near future. We hope that a diverse group of people will attend the course, and we want to ensure that everyone who attends feels welcomed and included.
